Gestalt is a python application to interface with generative UI libraries.


Established templates are combined with structured user data to create a 
series of command calls that will build up a screen, arrange widgets, and set
their properties. Layouts are provided to repeat batches of widgets along
a variety of arrangements with specified macros being mapped to user-given 
inputs.

Currently, caQtDM and CSS-Phoebus are supported.
